# Scalar TODO & Future Work

## Simulation Core

- [ ] **Advanced AI**: Implement different AI roles (Stalker, Defender, Sniper) with more complex behavior trees.
- [ ] **Pathfinding**: Optimize pathfinding and allow units to path around other units during planning.
- [ ] **Line of Sight**: Improve LOS calculations (currently simple range/block check).
- [ ] **Status Effects**: Add more varied status effects (e.g., Burn, Freeze, Hack-protection).
- [ ] **Terrain Types**: Add more terrain variety (e.g., difficult terrain, hazards).

## Game Layer

- [ ] **Visual Polish**: Replace geometric shapes with sprites/animations.
- [ ] **Audio**: Add sound effects and ambient music.
- [ ] **UI/UX**: Improve the command planning interface (e.g., drag-and-drop paths).
- [ ] **Fog of War**: Implement vision-based fog of war.
- [ ] **Loadout UI**: Implement module and consumable selection in the Station.

## Station & Meta

- [ ] **Persistence**: Save station state, recovered loot, and unlocked logs to LocalStorage.
- [ ] **Tech Tree**: More complex upgrades and drone customization.
- [ ] **Contract System**: Procedurally generated missions with varying rewards/difficulties.

## Tooling

- [ ] **Replay Editor**: A tool to modify and export replays easily.
- [ ] **Performance Benchmarking**: Monitor sim step performance with large numbers of units.
